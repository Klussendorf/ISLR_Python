# Introduction to Statistical Learning in Python

This repo use Python to re-produce the lab results from the book [**Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R**](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) wittern by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani. <br>It also includes the exercise solutions in Python3
